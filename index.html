		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Heya! You may know me as Koen. Or KoenProduk. Or KPRODK. Or microwave on a fridge. Or Miles. Regardless of how you know me, and what you know me as, here's a little bit about me :)</p>
	</div>
	<div id="border" style="margin-right: 60%; margin-top: -100px;">
		<h1>What I Do</h1>
		<p>I enjoy playing video games, especially fighting games and platformers. Some of my personal favourites are Street Fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, Rivals of Aether, The King of Fighters, and Guilty Gear. I am also a technology enthusiast. I enjoy working with computers and technology, and have a decent understanding of how they work. I like building computers, and dismantling them. I also enjoy programming small little scripts and programs. I am also a console hacking and Linux enthusiast.</p>

		<h1>What I Make</h1>
		<p style="text-decoration: none;">I am currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/microwave-on-a-fridge/fgcBot" target="_blank">Discord bot</a> (that you can find on my GitHub) that shows frame data for fighting games I am interested in. I've also made a <a href="https://github.com/microwave-on-a-fridge/ROA-Full-Completion-Save-File" target="_blank">100% save file + automatic installer for Rivals of Aether</a> (that you can also find on my GitHub), and I have made a few Sonic Mania mods, and will continue making them in my spare time. These can be found on my GameBanana, and maybe eventually my GitHub.</p>
